     Artificial intelligence and robots have been tools that are important in the engineering
     and manufacturing industry as it makes the processes easier for example in the car manufacturing
     industry. These two ideas could also be combined to explore the topic of artificial intelligence in
     surgical robots. This article will be looking into the advantages such as the accuracy, perception and
     automation and the disadvantages such as reliability, sensor noise, system integration and
     complexity as well as the future of AI and robots in the medical field.  </p>

    Recently surgical robot system (SRS) have been receiving widespread attention, as surgeons working
    on patients requires years of expertise and practice, therefore using an SRS would increase prescient,
    accuracy and would not be limited to physical limitations such as fatigue which a traditional surgeon 
    would experience. Along with the rise in surgical robots and AI, miniaturisation has been the latest
    goal in the medical field. “One such robot is ARES (Assembling Reconfigurable Endoluminal Surgical
    System) developed by Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna - CRIM Lab, Italy. The patient swallows the
    individual parts of the robot which then self-assembles inside the body ready to aid the surgeon.”
    (Liz Lear, 2011)
