        Artificial intelligence and robots have been tools that are important in the engineering
       and manufacturing industry as it makes the processes easier for example in the car manufacturing
       industry. These two ideas could also be combines to explore the topic on artificial intelligence in
       surgical robots. This article will be looking into the advantages such as the accuracy, perception and
       automation and the disadvantages such as reliability, sensor noise, system integration and
       complexity as well as the future of AI and robots in the medical field.

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3><h4 style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">
       Recently surgical robot system (SRS) have been receiving widespread attention, as surgeons working
    on patients requires years of expertise and practice, therefore using an SRS would increase prescient,
    accuracy and would not be limited to physical limitations such as fatigue which a traditional surgeon 
    would experience. Along with the rise in surgical robots and AI, miniaturisation has been the latest
    goal in the medical field. “One such robot is ARES (Assembling Reconfigurable Endoluminal Surgical
    System) developed by Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna - CRIM Lab, Italy. The patient swallows the
    individual parts of the robot which then self-assembles inside the body ready to aid the surgeon.”

    Da Vinci is a surgical robot system with the goal of  " helping surgeons provide the best minimally
    invasive surgery to as many patients as possible. Redesigned from the inside out, da Vinci 5 brings
    more than 150 design innovations and 10,000x the computing power1 to deliver greater surgeon
    autonomy, more streamlined OR workflow, and advanced data analytics." (Da Vinci 5 surgical 
    systems, 2025). The basic structure of surgical robots contains mechanical systems, control systems
    and human-machine interface. 
    
    Mechanical systems is the robotic arms, end effectors, and actuators. End effectors are  tools
    attached to the end of a robotic arms which performs tasks, these devices could be robotic hands,
    tools or sensors. The different types of effectors are used for different tasks for example robotic
    hands (also known as grippers) are mostly used in an assembly line, but in a surgical robot this could
    be used to pick up a scalpel or camera. Tools would be fitted according to the task you want to
    perform, and you would be able to modify the end effector according to that. Sensors are used for
    gathering data, types of sensors that could be used care force or pressure sensors. Actuators are also
    a mechanical aspect of robots, these are the parts that moves the robot, when compared to the
    human body they act as muscles and convert energy into mechanical motion. The different types of
    actuators are electric, hydraulic and pneumatic. Electric actuators use electric motors and are used in
    small and precise robots. Hydraulic actuators use pressurized fluids to create motion on these can be
    very powerful and are used in heavy- duty robots in industries such as construction. Pneumatic
    actuators use compressed air to move, these are fast but less precise compared to electric and
    hydraulic actuators, these are mostly used for pick and place robots in factories.

    
    Moving onto the control systems of surgical robots includes the kinematics, dynamic, and real- time
    feedback loops. Kinematics is all about the how the robot moves, for example if the surgeon wants to
    move the tool in a certain direction geometry and motion will have to be used to make sure the tool
    does not come into contact with any other organs as this could be a crucial mistake.  Dynamic control
    ensures smooth a stable motion in surgical robots. Finally real- time feedback loops start from an
    input in this case the surgeon moving the controls, then the controller calculates the desired position
    and the actuator moves the robot arms, sensors measure actual position, the final steps are
    comparison and correction.

    
    Human-machine interface (HMI) is the communication between the human and the robot (how the
    human gives commands and receives feedback). Main components in HMI are the input devices,
    output devices, control console, computer system, safety interface. There are also different types of
    feedback such as visual, force/ haptic, and auditory.

    
    Earlier systems depended heavily on human control, and AI integration in SRS aims to introduce
    increased precision, safety and efficiency.
